## Features  

- **Real-Time Communication**: Demonstrates how SignalR enables real-time updates without page reloads.  
- **Client-Server Interaction**: A practical example of how the server and client communicate seamlessly.  
- **Scalable Design**: Structured for extensibility and integration into larger projects.  
- **API Documentation**: Includes **Swagger** for clear API documentation and testing.  
- **Database Integration**: Uses **SQLite** with **Entity Framework Core** for lightweight and efficient data management.  
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Configured for secure client-server communication.  
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit testing to ensure application reliability.  
- **Containerization**: Configured with **Docker** to simplify deployment.

```
## .NET Best Practices
1. **Dependency Injection (DI):**  
   Ensures loose coupling and enhances testability.
2. **Entity Framework (EF) Core Migrations:**  
   Maintains database schema consistency across development environments.
3. **Swagger Integration:**  
   Provides user-friendly and interactive API documentation.
4. **Exception Handling Middleware:**  
   Ensures graceful error handling and consistent API responses.
5. **CORS Configuration:**  
   Allows controlled access to resources across different domains.
6. **Layered Architecture:**  
   Promotes clean separation of concerns for maintainable and scalable code.

## Angular Best Practices
1. **Reactive Forms:**  
   Implements a structured approach to form handling with improved validation.
2. **State Management:**  
   Effectively manages the component state using libraries like NgRx.
3. **Lazy Loading:**  
   Optimizes performance by loading modules only when needed.
4. **Service-Oriented Architecture:**  
   Ensures components are reusable and testable by relying on services.
5. **Strict Typing:**  
   Adopts TypeScript best practices for better reliability and maintainability.

# Use Cases
